					<description><![CDATA[Hi Marcel, I&#039;m reading all of your journal entries, and I love the authentic voice and photos, plus #WAHMST :D I&#039;ve also seen some familiar faces during your walk - including Niels and Luc. I think maybe places were closed because of the Ascension holiday, but anyway I know you have a great attitude and make the most of any situation. Looking forward to seeing you soon in Berlin!]]></description>
